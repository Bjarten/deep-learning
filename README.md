# Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains all the projects I did during the [Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

## Lessons

This folder contains notes and examples I took during the program.

Most of the data can also be found on the original Udacity repo: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning

## Project 1: Simple Neural Network

In this project I build and train a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Project 2: Dog Breed Classifier

In this project I design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Used transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve the model.

## Project 3: TV Script Generator

In this project I build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Used it to generate new episodes of The Simpsons, based on old scripts.

## Project 4: Face Generator

In this project I build a pair of Multi-Layer Neural Networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate realistic faces. Then training them on a set of celebrity faces to generate new ones.

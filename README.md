# Deep Learning

This repository contains projects around Deep Learning, including all the projects I did during the [Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) as well as lessons from other sources.

## Personal Projects:

### android-mlkit-sample

[android-mlkit-sample](https://github.com/miquelbeltran/deep-learning/tree/master/android-mlkit-sample)

In this project I build a simple TensorFlow model from scratch (just a multiplication of two tensors), export it to TF Lite and then open it with ML Kit from Firebase in an Android app.

This sample helps understand the different concepts and steps to export models and use them on Android applications.

## Udacity Nanodegree Projects:

### Project 1: Simple Neural Network

In this project I build and train a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

### Project 2: Dog Breed Classifier

In this project I design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Used transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve the model.

### Project 3: TV Script Generator

In this project I build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Used it to generate new episodes of The Simpsons, based on old scripts.

## Project 4: Face Generator

In this project I build a pair of Multi-Layer Neural Networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate realistic faces. Then training them on a set of celebrity faces to generate new ones.

### Project 5: Teaching a Quadcopter to fly with Reintforcement Learning

In this project I build a reinforcement learning neural network to help a quadcopter learn to fly.
